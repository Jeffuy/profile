## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm German Cavani, a web developer and aspiring analyst programmer with expertise in HTML, JavaScript, React, Next.js, CSS, and more. I'm passionate about innovation and problem-solving, and I love using technology to make the world a better place.

In addition to my programming work, I'm an experienced taekwondo instructor with over 10 years of teaching experience. I've trained over 300 students and instructors, and I'm proud to have coached Uruguay's only medalist in the ITF Taekwondo World Championships (Slovenia 2022).

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer and a person. Let's connect and see how we can work together!
